# Eric's SQL Portfolio
Welcome to my SQL portfolio. This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written.
Most of the code at the beginning will be code that I am writing as I learn about SQL and Data Analytics by following along with Charlotte Chaze's course material at https://breakintotech.teachable.com.

The course material at Break Into Tech features many SQL lessons from Khan Academy so materials will be drawn from there as well.
